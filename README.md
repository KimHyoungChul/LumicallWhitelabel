# LumicallWhitelabel
Lumicall is a free and convenient app for making encrypted phone calls from Android. It uses the SIP protocol to interoperate with other apps and corporate telephone systems.
This project adds the feature of "whitelabelling" in Lumicall application using productFlavors.
The white label version would have clientâ€™s name, logo, icons, themes etc which reflect their brand. Although, the underlying working of both the applications would be same. Client/ Flavor specific resources are in src/flavor-name directory.To run the desired version select that version from buildvariant menu.
